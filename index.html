    <h3>What is the DaveField?</h3>
    <p>The DaveField is an open exploration into hidden symmetries of prime numbers. 
       By projecting primes into lattice structures and crystal-like fields, unexpected 
       patterns emerge â€” resembling physics, geometry, and even cosmic structures.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to make these patterns visible and interactive, so anyone can explore them.</p>
