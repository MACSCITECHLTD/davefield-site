# DaveField

Exploring the hidden symmetry of primes.

This repository contains the source code for [DaveField.org](https://davefield.org),  
a project that visualises and explores patterns in primes, lattices, and crystal-like structures.

## What’s here
- **index.html** – the landing page
- **style.css** – basic styling
- More visualisations and interactive tools coming soon

## About
DaveField is an open exploration of number theory and symmetry.  
Think of it as a laboratory for prime structures, projections, and immersive visualisations.
