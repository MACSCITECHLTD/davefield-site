          <h3>The Conjecture on Prime Midpoints</h3>
          <p>
            One of the central threads in the DaveField project is a new conjecture about 
            <strong>prime pair midpoints</strong>. Prime pairs (or “twin primes” when they differ by 2) 
            have long fascinated mathematicians, but our work shifts the focus from the primes 
            themselves to the numbers that lie directly between them. These midpoints appear 
            to act like hidden markers — points where symmetry, divisibility, and information 
            flow intersect in surprising ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            By tracking and visualising these midpoints across vast numerical ranges, we begin 
            to see structures that resemble lattices or fields, hinting at deeper connections 
            between number theory and physical systems. The conjecture is still evolving, but 
            its early patterns suggest that prime midpoints may carry more structural 
            information than has previously been recognised, offering a fresh angle on one of 
            mathematics’ oldest mysteries.
