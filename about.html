      <h2>About DaveField</h2>
      <p><em>***** This site is new and under construction *****</em></p>
      <p>
        Founded by <strong>Dr Michael Maughan</strong> in 2024, DaveField is an open research project exploring the relationship between entropy, information theory, and fundamental physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is entirely non-commercial and unfunded — updates appear as time allows.  
        If you’d like to support the work, please see our <a href="contribute.html">Contribute</a> page.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In studying how information moves through numbers and fields, DaveField has uncovered glimpses of hidden symmetry within the primes, drawn links between entropy and structure, and explored concepts at scales ranging from <em>Quantum Chromodynamics</em> to <em>Black Hole Entropy</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining mathematics, lattice geometry, and interactive visualisation, the project aims to reveal patterns in number theory that resonate with physics, crystals, and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site documents the journey — from conjectures and experiments to tools, data, and visualisations.  
        Everything here is <strong>open-access</strong> and freely shared for anyone to explore.
